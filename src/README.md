# Nokolino Software

In this folders you can find the **Nokolino.ino** sketches. Choose **V3.0** for the **JQ6500** module, **V3.1** for the **JQ8400** module or **V3.2** for the **DFPlayer** module. Owners of an old Maker Faire 2018 kit use **V2.1**.  
  
Sometimes, other folders appear. They are **BETA** versions under development. Don't use them.
